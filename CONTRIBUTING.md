Contributor Guidelines for <media-fill> Tag

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the development of the <media-fill> tag! Your contributions are valuable in shaping this innovative HTML element for displaying animated text filled with media content. Before you get started, please review the following guidelines.

Issue Disclosure and Discussion

The first step for any substantive contribution is to either:

Find an existing issue directly related to your contribution.
Add a new issue to initiate discussions.
Issues serve as the focal point for individual reports and Working Group discussions, ultimately shaping the official specification language. Please note that most issues undergo extensive discussion before they are ready for a pull request with specific wording changes. Ensure that the entire problem space is explored in the discussion, and consensus has been reached among participants before drafting a pull request.

Normative and Substantive Contributions

The CSS Working Group operates based on the consensus of its membership and discusses all significant matters before implementation. Editors responsible for the <media-fill> tag specification triage issues regularly, but resolution timelines can vary due to issue complexity and work schedules.



After Discussion

Once the Working Group reaches a consensus, the editor may draft and commit the relevant changes for review by contributors, or a contributor may submit a pull request against the issue for review. It's strongly recommended that the editors of the <media-fill> tag specification be involved in any specification wording changes.

Reviewers and participants in the issue discussion are encouraged to review the changes and request corrections or improvements as necessary. Please use the Pull Request template when contributing to this repository.

Tests

For normative changes in specifications in Candidate Recommendation (CR) or later, as well as the pre-CR specifications listed below, please provide a corresponding web-platform-tests PR unless testing is not practical. Both PRs will typically be merged simultaneously. Do not merge a test change that contradicts the spec before merging the corresponding spec change.

Pre-CR specifications with this testing requirement include:

cssom
cssom-view
If testing is not practical, please explain why and, if appropriate, file an issue to address this later. Add the type:untestable or type:missing-coverage label as needed.

Non-Substantive Contributions

For simple spelling, grammar, or markup fixes unrelated to the <media-fill> tag's substance, you can issue a pull request without creating a corresponding issue.

Additional Resources

Specification source files are in Bikeshed format, and the CSSWG wiki contains more information on other CSSWG tooling.
